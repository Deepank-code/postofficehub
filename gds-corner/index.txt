# Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Scheme: Simple Explanation

## What is BYOD?

The **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** scheme allows post office delivery staff to use their **own smartphones for official delivery work** and receive a monthly payment for using their devices.

---

## Latest Update (2025)

- The **monthly reimbursement has been increased to Rs. 500 per month.**
  - Rs. 300 for smartphone usage (earlier Rs. 200).
  - Rs. 200 for data/voice/SMS charges (earlier Rs. 150).

---

## Conditions for Reimbursement

✅ Delivery staff must process **at least 90% of received articles through the mobile app** to get the reimbursement under the BYOD scheme.

✅ The **number of articles delivered will not be considered**; only app processing is mandatory.

✅ Supervisors and staff should be informed to handle all accountable articles through the app to avoid payment issues.

---

## Upcoming Mobile App Requirements

The **Integrated Mobile App (IMA) 2.0** will soon be rolled out under the IT Modernization Project 2.0, requiring **phones with better specifications.**

Minimum revised specifications for devices under the BYOD scheme are shared with divisions to ensure your device remains compatible.

---

## Payment Processing

Divisional Heads are directed to ensure **timely payment under the BYOD scheme** to encourage staff to continue using their devices and to motivate others to join the scheme.

Details of enrolled devices should be shared with the MO Division fortnightly in the prescribed format.

---

## Why BYOD is Important

- Encourages delivery staff to upgrade devices.
- Ensures faster delivery updates.
- Helps the Department adopt digital workflows easily.

---

### Summary

- BYOD reimbursement increased to **Rs. 500/month.**
- Must process **90% of articles using the app.**
- New app requires upgraded smartphones.
- Timely payments to be ensured for enrolled staff.

This helps the **Postal Department improve delivery efficiency while ensuring staff receive fair support for using personal smartphones.**

# GDS Leave Rules: A Complete Guide for BPM and ABPM

Gramin Dak Sevaks (GDS) are the backbone of the postal system in India, managing essential postal services in rural and urban areas. Understanding the **leave rules for GDS, including BPM and ABPM, is important for smooth functioning and to avoid salary deductions or service disruptions**.

---

## Types of Leave for GDS

✅ **Paid Leave:**

- GDS are entitled to **20 days of paid leave in a year**, credited as **10 days every 6 months**.
- If these paid leaves are not utilized within the year, they **will lapse** and **cannot be carried forward** to the next year.

✅ **Unpaid Leave:**

- GDS can also apply for unpaid leave if paid leave balance is exhausted.

✅ **Emergency Leave:**

- GDS can apply for emergency leave.
- Emergency leave **cannot be granted if the GDS is under put-off duty**.
- If emergency leave exceeds **two days at a time**, the additional days will either:
  - Be **adjusted from the paid leave balance**, or
  - Be treated as **unauthorized absence** if no balance is available.

---

## Leave Approval Authority

The approval process for GDS leave applications depends on the post held:

- **BPM Leave Approval:**

  - The **Senior Superintendent of Post Offices (SSP)** is the sanctioning authority for BPM leave.
  - The BPM must submit their leave application **through the Inspector of Post Offices (IPO)**, who will forward it to the SSP for approval.

- **ABPM Leave Approval:**
  - The **Inspector of Post Offices (IPO)** is authorized to sanction leave for ABPM directly.
  - The ABPM should submit the leave application directly to the IPO.

---

## Substitute Arrangement

During leave, GDS must **arrange a substitute** to handle day-to-day branch operations to ensure uninterrupted services to the public.

- Substitute details including **name, address, and bank account details** should be mentioned in the leave application.
- Substitute must be physically fit and capable of handling cash and post office operations.
