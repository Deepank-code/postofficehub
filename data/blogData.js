# Complete Guide to Post Office Recurring Deposit (RD)

## What is Post Office Recurring Deposit?

Post Office Recurring Deposit (RD) is a popular savings scheme that allows you to save a fixed amount every month for 5 years. Currently offering **6.7% annual interest**, it's one of the safest investment options backed by the Government of India.

## How Does RD Work?

### Basic Mechanism
- **Monthly Deposit**: You deposit a fixed amount (minimum ₹100) every month
- **Tenure**: Fixed 5-year period
- **Interest**: 6.7% per annum, compounded quarterly
- **Maturity**: After 5 years, you receive your total deposits plus interest earned

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Account Opening**: Visit any post office with required documents
2. **Monthly Deposits**: Deposit the fixed amount by 15th of each month
3. **Interest Calculation**: Interest is calculated quarterly and added to your account
4. **Maturity**: After 60 months, collect your maturity amount

## What Happens If You Miss a Deposit?

### Grace Period
- You get a **15-day grace period** after the due date
- No penalty if you deposit within this period

### Default and Penalties
- **₹1 penalty** for every ₹100 (or part thereof) for each month of default
- If you miss **4 consecutive deposits**, your account becomes discontinued
- You can revive a discontinued account by paying all dues with penalty

### Example of Penalty Calculation
If you have a monthly deposit of ₹1,000 and miss 2 months:
- Penalty = ₹10 per month × 2 months = ₹20

## How is Maturity Calculated?

### Formula Used
The maturity amount is calculated using the compound interest formula:
**M = P × [((1+r)^n - 1) / r] × (1+r)**

Where:
- M = Maturity Amount
- P = Monthly Deposit
- r = Monthly Interest Rate (6.7% ÷ 12 = 0.558%)
- n = Number of months (60)

### Practical Example
For a monthly deposit of ₹1,000:
- Total Deposits = ₹1,000 × 60 = ₹60,000
- Maturity Amount = ₹69,730 (approximately)
- Interest Earned = ₹9,730

## Benefits of Post Office RD

### 1. Government Backing
- 100% safe and secure
- No risk of losing principal amount
- Government guarantee on returns

### 2. Better Interest Rates
- Higher than most bank RDs
- Fixed rate for entire tenure
- No market fluctuation risk

### 3. Tax Benefits
- Interest earned is taxable
- No TDS if interest is below ₹40,000 annually

### 4. Loan Facility

- Interest rate: 2% above RD rate

## Comparison with Bank RDs

|---------|---------------|---------|
| Interest Rate | 6.7% | 5.5-6.5% |
| Safety | Government Backed | DICGC Insured |
| Minimum Amount | ₹100 | ₹100-1,000 |
