Have you ever heard your parents say, ‚Äú‚Çπ100 doesn‚Äôt buy what it used to‚Äù? That‚Äôs **inflation** in action.

---

## What is Inflation?

**Inflation means the price of things you buy increases over time, while the value of your money decreases.**

---

### üßÉ An Easy Example

Imagine you could buy:

- 1 litre of milk for ‚Çπ40 last year.
- This year, the same milk costs ‚Çπ45.

The milk didn‚Äôt change, but you now need **more money for the same thing**. This rise in prices over time is **inflation**.

---

## Why Does Inflation Happen?

‚úÖ **Increased demand:** When more people want a product, prices rise.  
‚úÖ **Higher production costs:** If petrol, electricity, or raw materials get costlier, prices go up.  
‚úÖ **Currency value:** If the Rupee weakens against the Dollar, imported items cost more, increasing overall prices.  
‚úÖ **Government policies:** Sometimes, changes in taxes or interest rates can affect prices.

---

## How Inflation Affects You

- Your **savings lose value** each year if kept idle in cash or low-interest accounts.
- The **cost of groceries, school fees, and essentials** keeps rising.
- Your **future plans like children‚Äôs education, marriage, or retirement** become costlier.

---

## Why Should You Care?

If your money **earns less than the inflation rate**, you are actually **losing money silently every year**.

For example:

- If inflation is 6% and your savings earn only 3%, your money‚Äôs value reduces by 3% yearly.
