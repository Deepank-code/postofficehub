The **Post Office Recurring Deposit (RD) Scheme** is one of the most trusted saving plans in India, loved by millions for decades. Itâ€™s designed especially for individuals who wish to build a secure fund by depositing small amounts every month, while earning a steady interest.

Currently, the Post Office RD offers an attractive **interest rate of 6.7% per annum**, compounded quarterly. The minimum amount you can deposit is **â‚¹100 per month**, or any amount in multiples of â‚¹10. There is no upper limit, making it flexible for all income levels.

## Who Can Open an RD Account?

An RD account at the Post Office can be opened by:

- A single adult.
- Joint account holders (up to three adults, either Joint A or Joint B).
- A guardian on behalf of a minor.
- A guardian for a person of unsound mind.
- A minor above 10 years of age, in their own name.

You can open **multiple RD accounts** if you wish.

## How to Make Deposits

- You can open an RD account through cash or cheque. For cheques, the date of deposit will be the date the cheque is cleared.
- The **minimum monthly deposit** is â‚¹100, and you can increase this in multiples of â‚¹10.
- If you open the account on or before the 15th of the month, subsequent deposits should be made by the 15th of every month.
- If you open the account after the 15th, deposits must be made by the last working day of each month.

## What Happens in Case of Default?

- If you miss a monthly deposit, a default fee applies â€” â‚¹1 for every â‚¹100 denomination (proportional for other amounts).
- To continue, you must first pay the missed installment plus the default fee, then pay the current monthâ€™s deposit.
- If you miss 4 consecutive deposits, your account becomes **discontinued**, but you can revive it within 2 months from the fourth default. After that, no further deposits are allowed if not revived.
- If there are up to 4 missed deposits, you may extend the maturity period by the number of missed months and pay the pending installments during that extended period.

## Advance Deposit Option

- You can pay your RD installments in advance for up to 5 years.
- A rebate is available for advance deposits â€” for a â‚¹100 denomination, you get a rebate of â‚¹10 for 6 advance installments or â‚¹40 for 12 installments.
- Advance deposits can be made at the time of opening or anytime later.

## Loan Facility

- After you deposit 12 installments and the account runs for at least 1 year (without discontinuation), you can avail a **loan up to 50% of the balance**.
- The loan can be repaid in a lump sum or in monthly installments.
- The loan interest rate is **2% higher than the RD interest rate** and is calculated from the withdrawal date to the repayment date.
- If you do not repay the loan before maturity, the loan plus interest will be deducted from the maturity amount.
- To apply, submit the loan application form along with your passbook at the Post Office.

## Premature Closure

- You can close your RD account **after 3 years** from the date of opening by submitting the prescribed form.
- If you close the account prematurely, you will receive interest as per the Post Office Savings Account rate â€” even if the account is closed just one day before maturity.
- Premature closure is not allowed during the period for which advance deposits have been made.

## Maturity & Extension

- The standard RD account matures after **5 years** (60 monthly deposits).
- You can extend the account for another 5 years at the same interest rate applicable when the account was opened.
- An extended account can be closed anytime during the extended period. For completed years, the RD rate applies; for a partial year, the Savings Account rate applies.
- You can also keep the account for up to 5 years after maturity without making further deposits.

## Repayment in Case of Death

- If the account holder passes away, the nominee or legal heirs can claim the balance by submitting the required documents at the Post Office.
- The nominee or legal heirs may also continue the RD account till maturity by applying at the concerned Post Office.
