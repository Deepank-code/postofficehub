# GDS Leave Rules: A Complete Guide for BPM and ABPM

Gramin Dak Sevaks (GDS) are the backbone of the postal system in India, managing essential postal services in rural and urban areas. Understanding the **leave rules for GDS, including BPM and ABPM, is important for smooth functioning and to avoid salary deductions or service disruptions**.

## Types of Leave for GDS

âœ… **Paid Leave:**

- GDS are entitled to **20 days of paid leave in a year**, credited as **10 days every 6 months**.
- If these paid leaves are not utilized within the year, they **will lapse** and **cannot be carried forward** to the next year.

âœ… **Unpaid Leave:**

- GDS can also apply for unpaid leave if paid leave balance is exhausted.

âœ… **Emergency Leave:**

- GDS can apply for emergency leave.
- Emergency leave **cannot be granted if the GDS is under put-off duty**.
- If emergency leave exceeds **two days at a time**, the additional days will either:
  - Be **adjusted from the paid leave balance**, or
  - Be treated as **unauthorized absence** if no balance is available.

## Leave Approval Authority

The approval process for GDS leave applications depends on the post held:

- **BPM Leave Approval:**

  - The **Senior Superintendent of Post Offices (SSP)** is the sanctioning authority for BPM leave.
  - The BPM must submit their leave application **through the Inspector of Post Offices (IPO)**, who will forward it to the SSP for approval.

- **ABPM Leave Approval:**
  - The **Inspector of Post Offices (IPO)** is authorized to sanction leave for ABPM directly.
  - The ABPM should submit the leave application directly to the IPO.

## Substitute Arrangement

During leave, GDS must **arrange a substitute** to handle day-to-day branch operations to ensure uninterrupted services to the public.

- Substitute details including **name, address, and bank account details** should be mentioned in the leave application.
- Substitute must be physically fit and capable of handling cash and post office operations.
