## GDS Leave Rules 2025 – No More Manual Applications

![New GDS Leave Rules 2025](/blog/new-leave-rule-gdss.webp)

📢 **Important update for all Branch Postmasters (BPM) and Assistant Branch Postmasters (ABPM):**  
Leave application rules for GDS staff have changed in 2025. You no longer need to write leave letters to SSP or IPOs manually. The entire leave process is now handled online through the **ESS portal**.

---

### 📝 Old Method vs. New Method

#### 📌 Earlier (Before 2025):

- You had to **write a handwritten leave application**.
- Submit it physically to your **SSP (Senior Superintendent of Post Offices)** or **IPOs (Inspector of Post Offices)**.
- Then wait for approval through offline channels.

#### ✅ Now (From 2025 onwards):

- Leave is applied **online only** using the **GDS ESS Portal**.
- No handwritten or manual leave forms are accepted.
- Faster and more transparent process.
- Reduces paperwork and ensures timely approvals.

> 🚫 **Manual leave applications are no longer valid. Use the ESS portal only.**

### 👤 What if You Need a Replacement (Outsider)?

If someone else is going to do your duty while you're on leave:

- **Allowed only for ABPM** post.
- If BPM takes leave, **ABPM should take charge** temporarily.
- Outsider option for BPM is not permitted.

### 📎 Documents Required for Outsider (If Appointed)

If an outsider is selected to take charge, upload these to the portal:

1. Aadhaar card copy
2. PAN card copy
3. PoSB (Post Office Savings Bank) passbook copy
4. Valid email ID
5. Active mobile number (used for OTP verification)

⚠️ **Note:** If any of these details are missing, your leave application might be rejected or delayed.

### 🔔 Instructions for BPMs

- Make sure your ABPMs and GDS colleagues are aware of this new online system.
- Ensure all documents for the outsider are verified before uploading.
